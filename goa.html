        <h1 class="about"> What is the best time to visit Goa? </h1>
        <ol class="about2">
        <li> Famous for beach-life, Goa is best enjoyed under the bright sun. Winter is literally non existence.</li>
        <li>Tourist season in Goa spans from November to wee end of March. April is when school in India are closed 
            for summer and you are likely to see plenty of domestic families traveling to Goa.</li>
        <li>Head to Goa during monsoon, if you love nature. However for the postcard perfect Goa where golden sand 
            beaches stretch out till the horizon, dotted with coconut groves, you need to wait till dry month of winter.</li>

            <p class="about1">
                Most tourists coming to Goa think of it as a beach destination. While this may be true, 
                there is lots more to do in Goa that's beyond the beaches. There are two main islands in Goa - Divar 
                Island and Chorao Island. Both of these islands can be reached by taking a ferry from Ribandar, which 
                lies on the road between Panaji and Old Goa. Chorao Island is famously known for the Salim Ali Bird 
                Sanctuary. You can hire a little boat, watch the mangrove, spot birds and enjoy a languid boat ride in 
                the Goan rivers.

                    Goa was under the Portuguese rule for over 450 years from the 1500's until 19 December 1961. Due to this 
                    reason, there are striking churches scattered all across Goa. While the Panjim church and the Old Goa church 
                    are the two famous churches in Goa, it's the offbeat ones that steal the heart away. The Mae De Deus church 
                    and the Siolim riverside chapel are both exquisite and worth exploring!

        Before the Portuguese invaded Goa in the 1500s, Goa was under the rule of the Muslim ruler Adil Shah. While 
        Adil Shah built a number of forts for himself, after the Portuguese takeover, they modified some forts to suit 
        their needs. Thus every fort in Goa has a rich cultural and architectural significance. Chapora Fort, Aguada 
        Fort, Tiracol Fort, and Reis Magos Fort are the forts located in North Goa. On the other hand, Cabo de Rama Fort 
        is a well-known fort located in the South Goa district. Each of these forts offers spectacular views of the ocean. 
        While Chapora fort and Cabo de Rama fort don't have any timings, since they are cliff-top ruined forts, Aguada fort 
        and Reis Magos fort are open from the morning till 5.30 pm in the evening. Tiracol Fort, on the contrary, has 
        been <br>converted to the Fort Tiracol Heritage Hotel. You can book a stay here to live<br> in a palace, dine with 
        insane ocean views and to escape the hustle-bustle <br>of the crowds.
