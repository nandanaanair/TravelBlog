        <h1 class="about"> MUMBAI - The City That Never Sleeps </h1>
        <img class="mal" src="./uploads/maha.png">
        <p class="about1">
            Previously known as Bombay, Mumbai—aside from being the country’s most populous city—is India’s center of 
            financial and commercial activities. Founded on an ancient settlement, its name was derived from the local 
            goddess Mumba, a type of Parvati, the consort of Shiva, and one of Hinduism’s main deities. The city of Mumbai 
            dishes a unique charm, thanks to a wonderful paradox of modernity and tradition, chaos and beauty, squalor, and 
            glamor. Dubbed as the “City of Dreams,” it offers a lot more than what most people saw in the film “Slumdog 
            Millionaire". Boasting a bevy of attractions from ancient temples, historic streets, rows of magnificent Art Deco 
            buildings to a myriad of cultural activities, Mumbai definitely lives up to its moniker of abundant aspirations.

        <h1 class="about"> What is the best time to visit Mumbai? </h1>
        <ol class="about2">
        <li> Most travelers prefer the winter months from November to February as the best time to visit Mumbai. During this period, 
        the climate falls into a pleasant average of 17-28 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>The summer months from March to May is also an ideal season, although the weather is a bit warmer averaging from the 
        mid-20s to high 30s.</li>
        <li>The months from June to October are the wet season, where Mumbai’s city experiences heavy rains most days and gets

        <p class="about1">
            Mumbai’s Suburban Rail Network comprises three main lines: The Western Line, The Harbour Line, and the 
            Central Line. These three basically covers all areas of the city. Trains start operations at 4am and 
            closes at 1am. Mumbai’s Metro Line spans 12 stations and starts operations at 5:35 AM and closes at 11:45 PM.

        <p class="about1">
            Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) provides a comprehensive and round the clock bus services 
            connecting all Mumbai’s suburbs and districts’ routes. There are several bus stops found all over the city; 
            you just need to memorize the bus stops and bus number of the buses going to your destination—this can get tricky 
            for first-time visitors, but you can always ask the locals for directions.

            </ul>
        <p class="about1">
            Taxicabs come aplenty in black and yellow in Hyundai Santro and Suzuki Altos, which replaced the outdated 
            but classic Premier Padmini cars of yesteryears. It is easy to flag a cab on the street but negotiates with 
            the driver to use the taxi meter instead of agreeing to a contracted fare. Uber and Ola passenger sharing 
            apps are also widely available in Mumbai. You can easily book a ride by using these applications on your 
            mobile phone.

            </ul>
        <p class="about1">
            Auto-rickshaws are not allowed in the downtown area since it is only permitted in Bandra and Sion’s 
            western and central suburbs. Slower than taxicabs but cheaper, it is only recommended for a shorter length 
            of trips as a ride aboard an auto-rickshaw can be bumpy and less safe because it involves rash driving 
            through the busy streets Mumbai.

            <p class="about1">
                Also known as the “Taj Mahal of Mumbai,” the Gateway of India was built as a monument to commemorate 
                the visit of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911. Located at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg along 
                the water in Mumbai harbour, the basalt arch is approximately 26 metres highand tourists, vendors and 
                street hawkers combine to create a fair-like atmosphere around the majestic building. Situated on the 
                banks of the Arabian Sea, it is a popular destination among locals and tourists in Mumbai. The best time 
                to come is before and during sunset.

                    Fancy a walking exploration of Mumbai? Then start off at the 3.6-kilometer-long boulevard known 
                    as the Marine Drive. You can witness the Arabian Sea’s spectacular sunset and the ageless 
                    magnificence of Art Deco Buildings on the other site. The best time to come is also during sunset
