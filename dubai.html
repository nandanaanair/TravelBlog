        <h1 class="about"> HYDERABAD - The City of Pearls </h1>
        <img class="mal" src="./uploads/charminar.jpg">
        <p class="about1">
            Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana, is a colorful mélange of culture, cuisine, and commerce. 
            Magnificent monuments from the bygone-era with impressive architecture seem to be its defining feature. 
            At the same time, the city buzzes with posh malls, pubs, clubs, restaurants, and multiplexes, all of which 
            epitomize its vibrant and youthful side. For a traveler like me, this contrasting confluence results in an array of 
            sights and experiences that are a delight to soak in and explore.

        <h1 class="about"> What is the best time to visit Hyderabad? </h1>
        <ol class="about2">
        <li> Hyderabad during winter is a splendid affair. The climate is cool, the atmosphere is crisp, and the air is 
            fresh. While early mornings and nights can get quite cold, the days are graced with mild sunshine. For 
            exploration of the city, sight-seeing and nomadic wandering, this is the best season to visit Hyderabad in. </li>
        <li>The climate of Hyderabad in summer is severe. With soaring temperatures, high levels of humidity and a stagnant 
            atmosphere, the conditions can get quite unbearable. Although, early mornings and evenings are significantly better. </li>
        <li>The weather of Hyderabad in monsoon is nothing short of alluring. The average temperature is pleasant, 
            perfect for long strolls and drives. The climate is neither hot nor cold. The landscape is rejuvenated 
            with drizzles and showers, rendering the region a green paradise. </li>

        <li> By Bus </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="about1">
            Travelling by bus can be the cheapest way to commute in Hyderabad. The TSRTC operates buses which run in the 
            city and make it easy to cover the distance between different locations. There are five types of buses in 
            Hyderabad (Ordinary, Metro Express, Metro Deluxe, AC, Volvo AC). Volvo Buses are the most comfortable and 
            start at Rs. 35.

            <li> By Metro and Train </li>
            </ul>
        <p class="about1">
            The Multi-Modal Transport System (or MMTS) is the fastest service to reach your destination without any 
            hassles. Though the trains are always crowded, they only travel to <br>select destinations in the city. The newly 
            opened Hyderabad Metro Rail network includes 3 lines that also cover many parts of the city.

            <li> By Taxicabs/Uber and Ola </li>
            </ul>
        <p class="about1">
            Taxi is one of the best ways to commute in Hyderabad although slightly more expensive. While there are many 
            independent operators like Vayu Travels, it’s best to use the newer app based cabs such as Ola and Uber, 
            which assure service and courteous drivers. Metered Radio taxis are also available via their centralized 
            call centre and are especially useful if you are looking for longer distances. Uber and Ola passenger sharing 
            apps are also widely available in Mumbai. You can easily book a ride by using these applications on your 
            mobile phone.

            <li> By Autorickshaw </li>
            </ul>
        <p class="about1">
            Autorickshaws are often the best option for short distance travel. Many parts of the city also have shared 
            autos. However be warned, Autos in Hyderabad never charge by meter and always overprice. This often makes 
            cabs the cheaper option.

                Charminar is, undoubtedly, the most famous landmark in Hyderabad. Built over 400 years ago, this iconic 
                four-storied structure built in typical Islamic style houses a mosque on the top floor. Though there are 
                a number of stories related to the construction of this monument, the most widely believed one is that 
                Charminar was built to commemorate the eradication of cholera.While you are in the Charminar area, don’t 
                forget to treat yourself to a glass of Irani Chai and some Osmania biscuits from the nearby Nimrah Café 
                and Bakery.

                        hillside with your beloved to catch the sun in its beauty. You can also visit the famous 
                        Moula Ali Dargah that is located on top of the hill.
