                Hello Everyone - Travellers, Wanderers And The Ones Bitten By The Wanderlust Bug ;) <br>
                First of all thank you so much for taking out some time of your busy lives and stopping 
                here to know about my little wandering life! <br><br>

                Hi! I'm Nandana <br><br>
                A  19 year old wandering soul, born and based in Mumbai,India.
                <br><br>
                Currently a student as well as travel blogger. As a student we 
                can understand how hectic it is to balance travel and studies (mainly college) together! 
                Sometimes it seems like you’re stuck in a vicious cycle. But with full time being a student, 
                I still manage to travel. You know how?
                <br><br>
                Unlike others our survival list is a little different. It does include breathing, eating, 
                sleeping, drinking, bathing but then the list has one more thing in it and i.e. TRAVELING.
                <br><br>
                TheWanderHer is basically a site focusing on solo and female travel around the world.  
                On TheWanderHer, I mostly share my travel experiences, travel tips, packing guides, videos, 
                photography from all the destinations I have travelled to.
