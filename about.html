                Hello Everyone - Travellers, Wanderers And The Ones Bitten By The Wanderlust Bug ;) <br>
                First of all thank you so much for taking out some time of your busy lives and stopping 
                here to know about my little wandering life! <br><br>

                Hi! I'm Nandana <br><br>
                A  19 year old wandering soul, born and based in Mumbai,India.
                <br><br>
                Currently a student as well as travel blogger. As a student we 
                can understand how hectic it is to balance travel and studies (mainly college) together! 
                Sometimes it seems like you’re stuck in a vicious cycle. But with full time being a student, 
                I still manage to travel. You know how?
                <br><br>
                Unlike others our survival list is a little different. It does include breathing, eating, 
                sleeping, drinking, bathing but then the list has one more thing in it and i.e. TRAVELLING.
                <br><br>
                TheWanderHer is basically a site focusing on solo and female travel around the world.  
                On TheWanderHer, I mostly share my travel experiences, travel tips, packing guides, videos, 
                photography from all the destinations I have travelled to.

        <p class="about1"> 
            I'm currently an under graduate studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technonoly (second year) from
             V.G.Vaze College (Kelkar) - Mumbai University. Other than studies I have tried my hands at learning various activities 
             like sketching, video and photo editing, just to realize that I can write what I feel too. So yeah, I am the
             writer of this blog and I totally love what I do. <br>Apart from this, I'm a great fan of bollywood movies which
             plays a crucial role in making me daydream about visting the places from my travel bucket list.
