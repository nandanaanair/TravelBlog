        <p class="about1">
            As the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan, Jaipur is one of India’s most popular cities among tourists. 
            Part of the so-called “Golden Triangle” with New Delhi and Agra, travelers come to Jaipur to experience a city 
            teeming with palaces, temples, magnificent forts, colorful bazaars, and of course—lots of cows. All these plus 
            stunning architecture, culture and a lively culinary scene all combine to make what is also known as “the Pink 
            City” a can’t miss destination in India.

        <h1 class="about"> What is the best time to visit Jaipur? </h1>
        <ol class="about2">
        <li> The months of October until May are the ideal time to visit Jaipur. Scorching weather prevails from June 
            until August. I arrived in Jaipur on the month of January and found the day time temperature of 
            20°C and the nighttime 8°C pleasant and bearable with thick clothing.</li>
        <li>The winter temperature from December to February slowly warms into the succeeding months.</li>
        <li>The Jaipur Literature Festival in January, the Holi Festival in March and the Gangaur Festival also in 
            March attracts many visitors to the city.</li>

       <h1 class="about"> How to get around Jaipur? </h1>
        <p class="about1">
            Like most cities in India, the main transportation in Jaipur are the auto-rickshaws (Vikram), public buses 
            and the Metro Train System. Although the Old City (the Pink City) is very walkable, you can easily go around 
            and outside the city center by taking these main modes of transportations. There are designated bus stops 
            found all over the city. Make sure what bus numbers you need to ride to your destination. You can check this 
            link to learn about the bus routes in Jaipur. The first phase of Jaipur Metro completed in 2014 now operates 
            a total length of 9.63 kilometers or a total of 9 stations from Chandpole Bazaar to Vivek Vihar.

        <ul class="about3">
            <li> Hawa Mahal </li>
            <img class="image2" src="/uploads/hawamahal2.jpg" height="40%" width="40%">
            </ul>
            <p class="about1">
                The iconic facade of Hawa Mahal is one of the must-see landmarks in Jaipur. Also known as the 
                “Palace of the Winds”, this architectural marvel standing pyramidical 50 feet high is made of red and 
                pink sandstone and highlighted by 953 jharokha windows embellished with latticework. Hawa Mahal was built 
                in 1799 and is a prime example of Rajput architecture prevalent in Jaipur during those days. It served 
                as an extension of the women’s chamber where the royal ladies would peek at the windows to observe the 
                everyday life outside. The narrow design of the hallway and the direction it faces allows the wind 
                (“Hawa” in Hindi) to circulate <br>inside—thus giving the palace its moniker.

                </ul>
                <p class="about1">
                    Oozing with a beautiful fusion of Mughal and Rajput architecture, the City Palace covers a palatial 
                    complex nearly the size of one-seventh of the whole of the Pink City. Inside, you can get magically 
                    lost into a series of lush gardens, royal residences, private halls, courtyards, museums, and olden 
                    buildings. The Chandra Mahal—the residence of the current Maharajah of Jaipur—is also located inside 
                    the City Palace compound.

                    <p class="about1">
                        Also known as the Central Museum, the Albert Hall Museum conveys a fine example of Indo-Saracenic 
                        architecture. Designed by Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob, it was first opened in 1987. Today, the 
                        museum is visited by art enthusiasts because of its impressive collections of paintings, metal 
                        sculptures, crystal works, carpets, Ivory and other historical artifacts. You can relax in the 
                        gardens with the stunning view of Albert Hall in the backdrop. It is certainly a great place to 
                        get a peek into the history and ancient culture of India.

                        The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Jantar Mantar is a complex that houses nineteen 18th-century
                         architectural astronomical instruments including the world’s largest sundial. It was completed 
                         in 1734 upon the order of Maratha Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II. This observatory that measures 
                         celestial positions and timings uses the methods of “Ptolemaic positional astronomy” used by 
                         earlier civilizations. The instruments at Jantar Mantar used to supply accurate readings before 
                         towering modern buildings blocked the view of the nighttime sky.

                    <p class="about1">
                        In Jaipur, bazaars fill all corners of the ‘Pink City’ with at least 7 main bazaar districts. 
                        To fully explore these bazaars, it is highly recommended to walk from Hawa Mahal going to 
                        Chandpole and Bapu Bazaar. Along the way, you will pass by countless shops selling an assortment 
                        of items from jewelries, colorful fabrics, footwears (especially the “jootis” –a specialty 
                        women’s shoes of Rajasthan), utensils, carpets, trinkets, blanket, elephant pants, sarees, 
                        leather bags and a whole lot more. It’s safe to assume that you won’t leave Jaipur without 
                        extra luggage filled with assorted fancy items.

                        part of “Hill Forts of Rajasthan”—along with five other forts—inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage 
                        Site. Impressive architecture abounds inside in the form of temples, gates, ramparts, royal 
                        residences, courtyards, and halls—with each of the structures telling interesting bits of history.

                        Located 10 kilometers outside of Jaipur, Galtaji Temple is a complex comprised of a series of 
                        temples and is known as an ancient Hindu pilgrimage site. Galtaji is highlighted by a natural 
                        spring that streams out of the hill and fills a series of pools referred to as “sacred kunds”,
                         where the pilgrims bathe. It is also known as the “Monkey Temple” because of the presence of 
                         countless Rhesus Macaques.
